//! Common core component tests.
//!
//! This module contains unit tests for fundamental RISC-V data structures and
//! components, such as address types and register files.

/// Unit tests for system-wide constants.
///
/// This module verifies that global constants are defined with correct values
/// and maintain expected mathematical relationships, including page sizes,
/// instruction masks, and delegation bits.
pub mod constants;

/// Unit tests for address arithmetic and type construction.
///
/// This module verifies the behavior of virtual and physical address types,
/// including page offset calculations and value extraction.
pub mod address_arithmetic;

/// Unit tests for RISC-V register file indexing and behavior.
///
/// This module verifies the functionality of General Purpose Registers (GPRs)
/// and Floating-Point Registers (FPRs), ensuring correct read/write operations
/// and adherence to architectural constraints like the hardwired zero in `x0`.
pub mod register_indexing;

/// Unit tests for error and trap handling.
///
/// This module verifies trap types, translation results, and error handling
/// mechanisms used throughout the simulator.
pub mod error;
